The 41st ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming
Languages (POPL 2014) will be held in San Diego, California.

POPL provides a forum for the discussion of fundamental principles and
important innovations in the design, definition, analysis,
transformation, implementation and verification of programming
languages, programming systems, and programming abstractions.

Both experimental and theoretical papers on principles and innovations
are welcome, ranging from formal frameworks to reports on practical
experiences.

Proposals are invited for workshops and other events to be co-located
with POPL 2014. Events can either be sponsored by SIGPLAN
(http://acm.org/sigplan/) or supported through in-cooperation status.

Workshops should be more informal and focused than POPL itself,
include sessions that enable interaction among the workshop attendees,
and be fairly low cost. The preference is for one-day workshops, but
other schedules can also be considered.
